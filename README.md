# Astra

> The first game I ever created

This was a project from back around 2013, and it was the first game I ever created. Needless to say, my code quality was sub-standard and I'm sure the logical inconsistencies and bugs are numerous. However, I thought I should release this, seeing as it is an ancient piece of my history.

## Installation

Just download the latest JAR file [off of the releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/Astra/releases). There are no dependencies or tools you need to install, just double-click on the JAR file once it downloads.

## Compiling

To compile this yourself, simply download the GitHub repository and build with Maven:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rayzr522/Astra.git
cd Astra
mvn
```

The compiled JAR file can be found in the `target` subdirectory.
